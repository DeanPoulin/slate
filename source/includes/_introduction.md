Welcome to the HMS Developer API Documentation Site!

This wiki is used by Health Market Science (HMS) to provide documentation on the use of HMS APIs for access to HMS's comprehensive data on the health care industry.

The HMS APIs use a REST interface, which is reflected in the documentation provided.
