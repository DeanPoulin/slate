# Security Credentials

HMS APIs utilize HMAC-SHA1 security, which requires use of the security credentials provided by HMS at the time a contract is established. This page explains the nature and use of the security credentials. If you have not already contacted HMS and received these credentials, please check the Home page for instructions.
